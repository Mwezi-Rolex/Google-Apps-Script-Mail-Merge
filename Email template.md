Hi {{First name}},

We'll unpack research-backed strategies to turn these interests into profitable side hustles. Whether you're starting from scratch or want to level up an existing idea, this event will give you real, tested insights to help you grow.

Event Details:
Date: Friday, 21 June
Time: 2:00PM - 4:00PM
Special highlight: Stanley Cup giveaway for the raffle winner
